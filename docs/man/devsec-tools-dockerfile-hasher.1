.SH NAME
.PP
devsec-tools-dockerfile-hasher - Rewrites a Dockerfile with SHA256 digests of the images.


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBdevsec-tools dockerfile-hasher [flags]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Since Docker tags can be re-pointed to different images, it is often useful
to rewrite the Dockerfile with the SHA256 digest of the image.

.PP
This command reads the contents of the Dockerfile from disk and parses it
into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). It then rewrites the lines in the
Dockerfile with the SHA256 digest of the image.

.PP
This is described (briefly) in the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Docker
Benchmark, in section ยง6.1.
