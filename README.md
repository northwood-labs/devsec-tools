# Docker Image Digest

Reads your Dockerfile(s) and replaces Docker image tags with Docker image hashes. Ideal for production environments so that the Docker images you rely on don't introduce changes without your knowledge.

Can be used as a CLI tool, a Go library, or a GitHub Actions _action_.

More TBD.
